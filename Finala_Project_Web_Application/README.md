# MBTI Personality Analysis and Prediction
## Coorperate Course Project: EECS 6893 Big Data Analysis
- Link to our web application: [Click Here](http://34.23.131.207:5000/).
- Created a Web application that could use users Tweets to predict their personality.
- Trained a machine learning model using MBTI personality dataset.
- We used Flask as backend and HTML, CSS as frontend. When user enter their username we would fatch user's Tweets using Twitter API(tweepy). Then we would process fatched data and use pretrained model to make prediction. Then we would present corresponding results to user.
